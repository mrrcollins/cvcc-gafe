The implementation of Chromebooks and Google Apps for Education will require an investment of not only technology, but in the staff and students of Cuyahoga Valley Career Center. Acquiring the technology is a small component in the implementation of Chromebooks, and GAfE, whereas professional development and support of instructors will have a major role in the implementation and success of this initiative.

Along with training in the use of the new technologies, this plan will also address online student safety and the appropriate uses of technology, including social media. While CIPA and COPPA addresses what school districts and companies are required to do, they are very broad in their reach. The professional development for staff and students will cover some of these deficiencies.

Over the next year, staff will become comfortable with using Chromebooks to access the Google Apps for Education suite and integrating it into their instruction. Since GAfE encompass a very wide variety of applications, this year will focus on the main aspects of GAfE: Gmail, Drive, Docs, Sheets, and Slides. 

The following pages will map out a timeline for the first year of implementation, along with goals and benchmarks to help guide the district and provide a status on how well the implementation is being enacted. This document is being written to give staff and students guidelines on what will be taught and what will be expected of them in the following school year. 

Brief help sheets on the GAfE products will also be a part of this document, making it a one stop shop for staff and students. A glossary of terms is also included.
