Introducation
=============

These are exciting times for the Cuyahoga Valley Career Center. With the introduction of Google Apps for Education and a 1:1 program with students using Chromebooks, staff and students will be able to embrace the 4-Cs of 21st century learning: communication, collaboration, creation, and critical thinking.

What is this?
-------------

The information contained on the following pages will be published on a website and also be available in PDF and ePub format. The goal is to provide staff and students not only a roadmap on how these new technologies will be implemented, but also help answer why these new technologies are being implemented.

Updates and changes
-------------------

Google is constantly updating their apps, and as such, this document and other training materials will always be in a state of flux.
